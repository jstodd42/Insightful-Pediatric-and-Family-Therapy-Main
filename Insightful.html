        <p class="content is-small is-mont-p is-spaced"> When people ask me why I chose to become a therapist, my answer… "It chose me!" I graduated from Tennessee Technological University in 2013 with my Master’s in Mental Health Counseling and I have been practicing since. I am a Therapist that provides services to all ages, and diversified backgrounds. I have experience working with trauma and recovery for all ages. I worked several years to the Upper Cumberland Children’s Advocacy Center in Cookeville, Tennessee providing trauma-focused therapy to children and families that have been part of trauma related events. I have experience treating issues such as anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress to name a few. I have completed specialized training in trauma and other modalities. I use different approaches that may include Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), and Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT). When I am not working, I like to spend time with my family, and I enjoy all sports and being outdoors.</p>

          <p class="content is-small is-mont-p is-spaced"> I began my journey in social services in 2004 when I began working with victims of domestic violence and became familiar with Upper Cumberland resources for those in need. In 2009, I began working with victims of child sexual abuse and their non-offending caretakers in order to connect them with needed resources and provided parenting education for those working with children with behavioral health issues. I graduated from Tennessee Technological University in December 2015 with my undergraduate focuses on Child Development and Family Relations. I chose to further my education with my Master’s in Social Work and graduated from University of Tennessee May of 2019. I am currently working towards my state licensure. I have also worked for the state as a Child Protective Services Investigator and was a contracted Family Services Worker as well. I currently work with Ten Broeck Tennessee providing therapy in both inpatient and outpatient setting. I use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) along with other modalities. My passion is working with families to help stabilize and promote a healthy environment. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and/or your family. Outside of working as a therapist, I enjoy spending time with my family, I love nature and love to be able to be in it! The beach is my happy place, gardening and landscaping is my Spring and Summer fun and I enjoy reading with a cozy blanket and coffee. I also enjoy using essential oils and learning more about them.</p>
